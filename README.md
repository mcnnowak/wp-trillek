# On hold

This theme may not get used now. We are probably going to use a static site for trillek.org and stick WordPress on blog.trillek.org. This will use an excellent tried and tested theme for now.

It will make the writers, readers and me a lot happier. It's definitely for the best.

# Trillek

This is the theme for [trillek.org][trillek-site], an open source game inspired by Notch's [0x10^c][0x10c]. You can find more information in the [sub-reddit][] and [forum][].

## Dependencies

This theme uses [SASS][], [Compass][], [Normalize.css][] and [SUSY][] for styling. You can fetch these ruby gems with this command.

```bash
bundle install
```

You can then compile the SASS manually with `compass compile assets` or compile it on change with `compass watch assets`.
